# CG Modern OpenGL Project

## Project Overview

This project showcases a **Modern Duplex Home with Yard** using **OpenGL** for 3D graphics rendering. The project focuses on the implementation of real-time rendering techniques, showcasing a detailed 3D model of a duplex home along with a yard. This project leverages **OpenGL** and modern graphics techniques to create an immersive 3D experience, with a special emphasis on accurate lighting, shadows, and textures.

### Key Features
- **3D Rendering** of a modern duplex home with an adjacent yard.
- **Real-time lighting** effects and accurate shadow rendering.
- **Texturing** for walls, floors, and landscaping elements.
- Interactive camera controls to navigate through the scene.
- **Optimizations** for smooth performance on real-time applications.
